This project is about retrieving the documents and building an inverted index . It also includes implementation of
1. Term at a Time AND algorithm 
2. Term at a Time OR algorithm
3. Document at a Time AND algorithm
4.Document at a Time OR algorithm

Above algorithms are implemented for a test input . The output is a posting list which varies as per the algorithm . Scoring is not considered. The project is implemented in Java using the Eclipse IDE
